# Traversal-Based Positional Encodings for Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains the code and experiments for our project in the course **0368309001 â€“ Machine Learning with Graphs** at **Tel Aviv University**.  

The project investigates traversal-based positional encodings for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), with a focus on **Breadth-First Search (BFS) ranks**. We evaluate their effectiveness against baseline models and alternative positional encoding strategies on standard graph classification benchmarks.
